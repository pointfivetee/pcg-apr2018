A procedural procedural generation challenge generator for r/proceduralgeneration's procedural procedural generation challenge generation challenge. (...did I get that right?)

This generator uses the MediaWiki API to pull a random category page from Wikipedia and populates the output with the category title and a few examples.

The output is markdown suitable for posting to Reddit.
